## Sentiment Analysis
In *04_sentiment_analysis* we calculate sentiment scores for text data using three different methods: AFINN, Syuzhet, and Bing. The calculated scores are added to the original data frame as new columns and visualized in a plot. This code provides an example of how different sentiment analysis methods can be applied to a dataset of text data to calculate sentiment scores and visualize them.
